# Notes Part 6

## Episode 58: The Will to Power

The Flock take a bow in the wake of their arena victory, and head to the meeting room where the new treatise of Reece will be signed. They are greeted by Ephialtes (EFF-ee-all-tees), former magnate of the black faction, who coyly gave them a tip for their victory and implied an interest in future ventures.

After exchanging some brief niceties with The Oracle and Dracuil, the Flock head back to Calicyon to take better stock of their affairs and await a meeting with Draciul. Tywin finds that Alexios has been busy while he has been away, and has begun construction of a mansion on the island as well as begun preparations for some vineyards. A few varieties of grapes have been secured:

- Sunburst Grapes
- Mooflake Grapes
- Green Goddess Grapes

As Tywin and Carlo begin to pore over the pile of magic swords they had received from the arena bout, Pewt announces that he had wagered a siginficant portion of the crew's assets on the result of the fight, and as a result the Flock are owed 12 new ships as well as having been paid out 80,000 gold pieces that Pewt had had carried in a heavy chest. After some debate (and some scolding Pewt for so flippantly gambling with other peoples' money), the Flock resolve to use the gold as an investment in a new Wizards' Tower in their lands in the eclipse kingdoms.

Draciul finally appears, laden with the news of the world. It seems that one of the Yankos is dead, and most of the OGW's navy is busily attending the impending war over the remains of her empire. Meanwhile, the Flock had been named official Warlords in service to the OGW.... for about two days before it is officially revoked. New bounties are also up, which put the total bounty for the crew to nearly 1,000,000 gold and officially named them enemies of the state (what else is new). Draciul then relates a tale of his past, being orphaned, a longtime rivalry with Sadhbh, and setting out to become the greatest swordsman in the world. His tale leaves him empty, however, with nothing left to achieve. The Flock tell Draciul of their quest, leaving him with much to think on.

Nail appears with a message from Kurthnaga: Kurthnaga needs the flock to head to Wano and secure allies before the coming conflict. After some discussion, the flock have a plan of action:

- Check in on Shepherd's Rest
- Visit Alabasta to recruit wizards for the tower
- Get the tower started in Spearval
- Head south and begin Kurthnaga's mission

## Episode 59: Archipelago Economics

The flock depart Calicyon for Shepherd's Rest, where they are greeted by their staff and good news of the progress being made on the now-bustling port. The marketplace has reached profitability, and the flock make a few useful purchases:

- Tywin arranges for a construction materials representative from the Beedles to be sent out to Portlandia
- Carlo buys Teleportation Circle from a Blue Beedle
- Tywin buys several preservative canisters, and puts an investment in the Istan-based Gnome Physics company, with a promise of future distribution support.

In Alabasta, Tywin and Carlo meet with Kazadrel Locthwain about the plans to establish a wizard's tower in Spearval. Kazadrel agrees to send a contingent of retirees and eager graduates with some specialization to get started on the research operations there.

They head to Istan (which is swarming with marines) next to inquire about their recent ship acquisitions, and Leetus Iceberg gives them a tour:

6 Small ships (8 cannons total)
3 Light Ships (8 cannons per side)
2 Frigates (15 cannons per side)
1 Brass Kraken (armored plating, 24 cannons per side with additional 6 frontal cannons. )

On the way to the eclipse kingdoms the Flock have a distant and luckily peaceful encounter with ships that seem to be the fleet of one of the Admirals. Upon arriving, they find Portlandia has a large encampment of marines that are disrupting the restoration operations. Tywin conducts several meetings with the vice admiral, merchants' council, the Queens, and the Beedle merchant in order to get things moving again. 

Their business in various kingdoms concluded for now, the flock turn there eyes southward...
