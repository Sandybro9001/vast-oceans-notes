### Episode 53 (5-16-21): "Bookkeeping"

This is the first set of notes written directly on this page. 

Continued searching the ruins of Solas, headed to the underground library made of bismuth.

Met some 'skeletal stewards' of the library and received library cards. We were directed to the history section, and eventually led to the RESTRICTED section to read some contraband books. Found some local history to help with Portlandia as well. 

Back in Sunspot Bay Tywin did some additional work on the initialization of the Portlandia restoration project. 

In this episode we also created a new spell, which is in Carlo's stash of Spellbooks:

Antique Restoration:
1st Level, Wizard, Ritual 
Restore one object of up to medium size or several smaller objects the wear and tear of ages. Especially books. Higher levels allow for more ambitious restoration projects.
