# Notes Part 5

## Episode 53 (5-16-21): "Bookkeeping"

This is the first set of notes written directly on this page.

Continued searching the ruins of Solas, headed to the underground library made of bismuth.

Met some 'skeletal stewards' of the library and received library cards. We were directed to the history section, and eventually led to the RESTRICTED section to read some contraband books. Found some local history to help with Portlandia as well. 

Back in Sunspot Bay Tywin did some additional work on the initialization of the Portlandia restoration project.

In this episode we also created a new spell, which is in Carlo's stash of Spellbooks:

Antique Restoration:
1st Level, Wizard, Ritual
Restore one object of up to medium size or several smaller objects the wear and tear of ages. Especially books. Higher levels allow for more ambitious restoration projects.

## Episode 54 (5-24-21): "A brief interlude with the land of cigars"

Departed from the eclipse kingdoms, headed for Nidaverllir.

Came upon a mysterious fog.....

Ninjas! The Scrupulous Flock are on the scene. Defeated Kisame and his crew of Shinobi. Why were they here?

Sanada Sue is aboard the ship! Secured an alliance for Kurthnaga and got some intel on the akatsuki (one of whom is now dead). Also got some cigars!

## Episode 55 (6-20-21): "Ashes to Ashes"

We met with the dwarves in the Channel of Hammers. Ran into Domingo the Wingull, servant of the dragon Yvneth the Ashbelly. He decided that he didn't think we were really realtors, despite that being true. Subdued Domingo, and learned that the Hammer place is inhabited by some number of drow. Moments later he makes the questionable tactical decision to set the drow upon us while also informing us that the drow's sould are bound to him... as long as he lives. We point this out and he releases the drow.

One introduces himself as Phadar, and after some negotiations, Domingo the Wingull releases the souls of all the drow on the island and flees. Phadar and some of the freed drow lead us through the volcano through servant's passages, allowing us to catch Yvneth unawares. 

The Flock descended upon Yvneth, raining attacks down on the sleeping dragon. Yvneth began to fight for his life, but after a few rounds of harrying from horseshoes and vicious strikes from Diana and Tywin's enchanted blades, the dragon fell. 

After the retaking of Hammer's deep, the flock participated in peace talks with the remaining dragonborn and the Dwarven council. The flock were paid out a bounty of items and gold as agreed, and the dwarves also agreed to give the remaining peoples that served under Yvneth passage to Portlandia, where they will train as farmers and craftspersons and begin building the city and farming the land above ground.

- Three dragonborn:
  - GreenEyes: Red, green eyes
  - Glimmer: Red, wings, golden horns/spikes
  - Spot: Red, Large white spots

- hundreds of kobolds.
- Phadar, Drow Scholar.
- 2000 drow, skilled as farmers and guardspersons.

The flock recieved heroic titles in the dwarven kingdom:

Tywin Ashbane
Diana Goldflame
Carlo Trueyes
Alithyra Ironstorm

They also claimed various draconic remains, including horns, scales, and teeth. Carlo's staff of the wolf also consumed the eye of Yvneth, gaining the power to confer true sight. Phadar, in league with several dwarves and other drow, agreed to repair the fractured drow moonblade that we discovered in the dragon's lair. Tywin and Diana made a sizeable investment into building and opening a trading post with private docks in Hammer keep's channel.

## Episode 56: Diary of a bunch of defeated swordsmen

Alithyra does some searching, and with Tywin's help finds and hires Illyena Taborwin as her personal attendant.

The Flock then head back to the Thiens, where Captain Toru and his crew wait to fight us for the fate of the Reese Archipelago. The Oracle informs us that we will fight in the Heaven's Arena in the center of the islands. Some investigation leads Tywin to Drake Valentine from the World News, who collects bounty information and with some convincing gives us some information on our opponents:

Captain Toru, the Golden Serpent

- An immortal swordmaster, has a style like that of a serpent, wielding his elegant rapier.

Fryrisha Gelvleaf, Storm Elf

- From the elven kingdom, world traveler, challenged Dracuil and barely survived. Uses two lightning blades, and manipulates the weather.

Grotle Spellblade, Mage Slayer

- Renowned bounty hunter known for jumping on and disabling mages.

Poru Hurka, Steel's Rage

- Half-Orc, ferocious guy, simple enhanced weapons, tanky.

Brandon Cano, Three Style Master

- Wields three swords at once, almost certainly magical, but masked by illusion.

Having finished up in Thiens, the Flock makes a brief stop at Calicyon to manage affairs, then heads to the Arena, hoping to meet with Draciul before the deadly bout. 

## Episode 57: John Cena returns from the bar

The Flock search the arena briefly before finding Draciul, and with some convincing he gives them advice on how to handle Toru and his crew. He also promises to tell them a story of a time long past should they emerge victorious.

After some planning and a day of rest, the time for the fight has arrived. Tywin and Sam engage Fryrisha, who after getting his weather manipulation counterspelled quickly retreats to the pool below the platforms in the arena. Grotle charges at Diana, and silences her, but is quickly cut down by the Flock's combined arms. Carlo is locked down by banishment from Brandon's Sword of Sinew and Steel, and the flock fight on as four.

As Fryrisha rejoins the fray, he is quickly dispatched, but Brandon and Poru Hurka retort with ferocious assault, dealing heavy damage to Tywin and Alithyra. Alithyra is knocked unconcious, but is quickly rescued by Samus, who lifts her into the air, and to safety.

Meanwhile, Diana siezes and opportunity to strike at Toru, and reverses the gravity beneath his feet. After Toru floats helplessly for a few seconds, gravity reasserts itself, and Toru crashes down into the platform and into Diana's clutches. Toru is taught a lesson in combustion by Diana, and just before he can recover himself to his feet, Tywin appears out of the ether and stabs him through the heart:

>*"The thing you need to realize, Toru, is that part of being the greatest swordsman in the world is keeping yourself out of situations like this."*  -Tywin Leroux

Alithyra wakes under Samus' protection, and turns her pain upon Brandon below, turning him into a lowly turtle. Brandon the turtle tries to escape into the pool, but the transformation ends Carlo's banishment...

...And Carlo wastes no time in getting down to business. He leaps from the platform, snatching the turtle in his dive, and driving the turtle forcefully into the bottom of the pool. The turtle is crushed, returning Brandon to his human form, but now at the bottom of a pool grappling a 500 pound warforged.

Tywin joins Carlo in handling Brandon at the floor of the pool, leaving Poru Hurka with no one to fight but a now invisible Diana. Poru flails wildly about the central platform, but after finding no purchase and being struck several times by Diana's blade, he surrenders, bellowing that none will stand and fight.

The flock clean up from the battle and lick their wounds, eager to hear Draciul's tale.
