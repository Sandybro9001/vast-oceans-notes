### Episode 53 (5-16-21): "Bookkeeping"

This is the first set of notes written directly on this page. 

Continued searching the ruins of Solas, headed to the underground library made of bismuth.

Met some 'skeletal stewards' of the library and received library cards. We were directed to the history section, and eventually led to the RESTRICTED section to read some contraband books. Found some local history to help with Portlandia as well. 

Back in Sunspot Bay Tywin did some additional work on the initialization of the Portlandia restoration project. 

In this episode we also created a new spell, which is in Carlo's stash of Spellbooks:

Antique Restoration:
1st Level, Wizard, Ritual 
Restore one object of up to medium size or several smaller objects the wear and tear of ages. Especially books. Higher levels allow for more ambitious restoration projects. 

### Episode 54 (5-24-21): "A brief interlude with the land of cigars"

Departed from the eclipse kingdoms, headed for Nidaverllir. 

Came upon a mysterious fog.....

Ninjas! The Scrupulous Flock are on the scene. Defeated Kisame and his crew of Shinobi. Why were they here?..... 

Sanada Sue is aboard the ship! Secured an alliance for Kurthnaga and got some intel on the akatsuki (one of whom is now dead). Also got some cigars!

## Episode 55 (6-20-21): "Ashes to Ashes"

We met with the dwarves in the Channel of Hammers. Ran into Domingo the Wingull, servant of the dragon Yvneth the Ashbelly. He decided that he didn't think we were really realtors, despite that being true. Subdued Domingo, and learned that the Hammer place is inhabited by some number of drow. Moments later he makes the questionable tactical decision to set the drow upon us while also informing us that the drow's sould are bound to him... as long as he lives. We point this out and he releases the drow.

One introduces himself as Phadar, and after some negotiations, Domingo the Wingull releases the souls of all the drow on the island and flees. Phadar and some of the freed drow lead us through the volcano through servant's passages, allowing us to catch Yvneth unawares. 

The Flock descended upon Yvneth, raining attacks down on the sleeping dragon. Yvneth began to fight for his life, but after a few rounds of harrying from horseshoes and vicious strikes from Diana and Tywin's enchanted blades, the dragon fell. 

After the retaking of Hammer's deep, the flock participated in peace talks with the remaining dragonborn and the Dwarven council. The flock were paid out a bounty of items and gold as agreed, and the dwarves also agreed to give the remaining peoples that served under Yvneth passage to Portlandia, where they will train as farmers and craftspersons and begin building the city and farming the land above ground. 

- Three dragonborn: 
* GreenEyes: Red, green eyes
* Glimmer: Red, wings, golden horns/spikes
* Spot: Red, Large white spots
- hundreds of kobolds. 
- Phadar, Drow Scholar. 
- 2000 drow, skilled as farmers and guardspersons. 

The flock recieved heroic titles in the dwarven kingdom: 

Tywin Ashbane
Diana Goldflame
Carlo Trueyes
Alithyra Ironstorm

They also claimed various draconic remains, including horns, scales, and teeth. Carlo's staff of the wolf also consumed the eye of Yvneth, gaining the power to confer true sight. Phadar, in league with several dwarves and other drow, agreed to repair the fractured drow moonblade that we discovered in the dragon's lair. Tywin and Diana made a sizeable investment into building and opening a trading post with private docks in Hammer keep's channel.
