# Notes Part 7

## Episode 61: "To Tell the Truth, You Don't Seem Like the Demonomanian Type"

Armed with only basic knowledge about the local political situation, the Flock make their way into Polvakia, where Aysha -the heir to the Owari Daimyo- is preparing to secure the throne of Polvakia.

The Flock are greeted by a suspicious pirate ship that they discover can be traced to the Black Phoenix Pirates. With rumors swirling that the Black Phoenix pirates are guests of the palace, they make haste to get started on unraveling the troubles of Polvakia. A covert search of the ship reveals a summoning circle and a crew of zombies, and Tywin seizes the ship's communication orb before departing.

The palace staff bring the Flock before the Queen Regent, who is governing the region in the King's stead during his illness. When Toronosuke Aysha is finally brought to recieve the message the Flock have for him, he responds with a tangled web of concerns. His in-laws are upset that his son will succeed the king, and are scheming against him, and Wano has developed a poor reputation for the success of its uprisings. He worries for the safety of his family and their autonomy should he leave.

The first and youngest brother-in-law is said to plagued by the dark arts, and the flock quickly discover that he has two infernal companions that have taken hold of him. Carlo's staff ends up being instrumental in letting Tywin and Carlo spot the fiends, and they are able to drive them off, giving Running-Skies the opportunity to cleanse the prince. After a long conversation with the prince about having more healthy desires, the Flock resolve to investigate the necromancer Jacob Yaagsnev, who is said to be keeping the king *unnaturally* alive.

## Episode 62: "The Polvakian Connection"

The flock stealthily track down Jacob Yaagsnev within the palace, and find him consorting with the eldest prince, Derrick, over covering up the king's imminent death. The flock report these plans to Toronosuke, who swiftly dismisses Jacob from the palace, much to Derrick's chagrin. Later that evening, as the royal family prepare for the King's death, Derrick bursts into Lord Aysha's chambers with murderous intent...

...Only to be cut down by Tywin, who had been lurking in the shadows. Tywin and Lord Aysha prepare to flee the palace immediately. Meanwhile, in the harbor...

...Carlo notices a disturbance with the stolen orb, and when he reaches the deck, spots an abyssal hand preparing to reclaim it. Carlo responds by catapulting the orb at the hand, shattering it, and from there the Flock's forces are on high alert. A short while later Jacob, who the flock ealier noticed is merely a puppet whose strings are being pulled by the demon Nifomorthus, sets out for the palace with his undead army in tow. The majority of the field crew from both of the Flock's ships launch a two-pronged attack to halt and engage Nifomorthus' forces in the streets of Polvakia.

The initial strikeforce ambushes the undead battalion and begins to shatter their line. Just as the scattered undead begin to to encircle the strikeforce, their reserve launches a volley of fireballs and charges, leaving the battalion in shambles. Nifomorthus attempts to negotiate, and then flee, but his retreat is cut off by Diana's rending stroke with the sword of truth and justice.

Shortly after the fighting in the streets has concluded, Tywin and Co. make their way to the scene of the battle and explain the rather immediate plans to depart. A quick sweep of Nifomorthus' abandoned ship produces the imp Zeegokkspek attempting to flee, but Carlo nabs the imp before he can escape. Under light duress, Zeegokkspek reveals the true nature of Nifomorthus' plots in Polvakia, scheming to subtly keep Toronosuke on the island and remove his competitors for the throne. He explains that this was a joint venture between the black phoenix pirates and the beast pirates, and provides some intelligience on Zod, one of Kaido's assistants.

Their business in Polvakia complete, the Flock depart with Toronosuke and his family aboard the Rothzagar.
