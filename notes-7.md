# Notes Part 7

## Episode 61: "To Tell the Truth, You Don't Seem Like the Demonomanian Type"

Armed with only basic knowledge about the local political situation, the Flock make their way into Polvakia, where Aysha -the heir to the Owari Daimyo- is preparing to secure the throne of Polvakia.

The Flock are greeted by a suspicious pirate ship that they discover can be traced to the Black Phoenix Pirates. With rumors swirling that the Black Phoenix pirates are guests of the palace, they make haste to get started on unraveling the troubles of Polvakia. A covert search of the ship reveals a summoning circle and a crew of zombies, and Tywin seizes the ship's communication orb before departing.

The palace staff bring the Flock before the Queen Regent, who is governing the region in the King's stead during his illness. When Toronosuke Aysha is finally brought to recieve the message the Flock have for him, he responds with a tangled web of concerns. His in-laws are upset that his son will succeed the king, and are scheming against him, and Wano has developed a poor reputation for the success of its uprisings. He worries for the safety of his family and their autonomy should he leave.

The first and youngest brother-in-law is said to plagued by the dark arts, and the flock quickly discover that he has two infernal companions that have taken hold of him. Carlo's staff ends up being instrumental in letting Tywin and Carlo spot the fiends, and they are able to drive them off, giving Running-Skies the opportunity to cleanse the prince. After a long conversation with the prince about having more healthy desires, the Flock resolve to investigate the necromancer Jacob Yaagsnev, who is said to be keeping the king *unnaturally* alive.
